// The seat's eye, its `player` row: it flies, and nothing stops it. `pos` [x, y, z] metres, `view`
// [yaw, pitch] radians (yaw θ looks along (sin θ, cos θ), pitch up). `before` puts it once on its
// slot's `start`, at that start's `pos` and `view`. Each step it moves its definition's `speed` metres
// a second, times 2 to the power of `pace`, along the view's yaw by `stick` (x to the right, y back),
// and up by `up` less `down`. `look` turns the view by the radians it is handed, its pitch kept within
// the definition's `pitch` of level; `pace` takes the wheel's turn, a tenth of a power of two a notch.
